web listening spotify emails checking facebook twitter light gaming since phones battery lasts long dont

oneui 20 review unit 4gb ram 64gb storageyou wont get great camera system thats one 
area think phone falls flat get 48mp primary camera sensor alongside 8mp ultrawide camera 5mp 
depth camera 48mp main sensor hit miss sometimes photos look great times photos come focus 
thats say camera bad consistent galaxy m21 takes bright shots cases images lack richness even 
though phone lets take ultrawide angle shots bokeh shots wasnt impressed comparison galaxy m31 galaxy 
m21 pales camera department change though galaxy m21s 20mp frontcamera surprisingly worked well indoors outdoorsthe 
galaxy m21 performs similarly galaxy m31 mean phones 6000mah battery identical processors displays even design 
galaxy m21 noticeably lacks however camera thats par galaxy m31 still theres lot love galaxy 
m21 still using old galaxy phones like galaxy j2 think galaxy m21 would make logical 
sense
