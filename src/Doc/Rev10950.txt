Good for the price, I guess, but I have a few issues: the screen would 
not sense my fingertips if my fingers were the slightest bit damp (I basically couldn't 
use it if it was really humid outside or I was working out) so I 
had to get plastic screen protectors which mostly solved the problem. I also have a 
problem with the phone randomly restarting itself at times (not too often, just enough to 
be annoying). I hate that if you want to turn the volume up past a 
certain point, the screen turns on and asks you to confirm that you want to 
expose your ears to a high volume.
