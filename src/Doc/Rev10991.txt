This phone has given me trouble since the very beginning. First the audio had a 
great amount of static, that problem was partially resolved after a couple of resets. Then 
the dropped calls started happening, I live in the heart of the city and have 
never had carrier-related issues with dropped calls. Then finally a few days ago, screen went 
completely dead. Now, I am back to using an older phone and I have no 
idea what to do with the phone I purchased. I have never owned an iPhone 
with so many issues. The earphones fell apart within a couple of days. The box 
that it came in seemed a bit shady, I am really not sure if the 
merchandise I received is actually a true out of the box Apple product.
