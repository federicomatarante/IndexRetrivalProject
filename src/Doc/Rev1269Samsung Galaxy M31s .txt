heres honest review weeks usage please take time read pros cons device ill start pros 
firstpros samsung display never disappoints good colors device pretty smooth use theres lag whilst browsing 
using multiple apps background sound output decent price rangecons battery life supposed last atleast day 
half 6k mah battery get 10 hours battery life normal usage whatsapp youtube music browsing 
finger print scanner upto mark since narrow thin button doesnt recognise print sometimes thick fingers 
maybe face unlock pathetic sometimes think scanning someone elses face times time never recognises face 
eventhough ive registered face bright environment low light forget notifications bug play whatsapp audio voice 
note constantly notifies annoying whilst riding listening music theres notification bg every song notifies annoying 
eventhough turned notification reminder camera quality decent great like theyve advertised low light shots grainy 
bright environments capture good pics screen recording notification lights although downloaded play store theres app 
whole point android phone basic feature previous cheap chinese huawei phone featuresanyway overall wouldnt recommend 
youre looking battery life itll disappoint im quite disappointed phone doubt id go samsung thanks 
reading good day
