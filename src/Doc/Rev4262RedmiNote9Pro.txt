light presentother issue google assistant tried many times wake assistant command ok google doesnt work 
ive set everything assistant essential use voice assistance useplease dont feel heart broken far two 
drawbacks found must say battery wow one full charge phone last almost 2 days normal

otherwise phones runs quite smoothly load games apps quickly
