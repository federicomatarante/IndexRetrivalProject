Forget about all the reviews out there saying this phone doesn't heat up. This phone 
heats UP big time! Especially after using for couple of minutes (just browsing and some 
Apping)!!! If you run Antutu, man, you probably can fry an egg on the nice 
etched back glass.However, you can't really blame on Sony, it's Qualcomm SD810's fault. But again, 
why do you want to use SD 810, Sony??? Just use the SD808! For God's 
sake, use SD801, who cares about 32 or 64-bit. So, it's kind of Sony's fault.Minus 
b**ching about SD810, the phone itself is great!Pros:- Great screen, beautiful color, and VERY bright.- 
Simple and nice UX- Camera focusing is fast, but images can be noisy indoor/low light- 
Very premium feel, wonderful design. Thumbs up for the back etched glass... No more fingerprints 
all over the phone!Cons:- Heat problem. Although Sony probably set a higher temperature threshold for 
apps to shut down by SW, you can still feel it.- Battery life isn't that 
great. I have a z3, and it seems to last longer and COOLER.- Volume bottom's 
location is a bit awkward.- Sony, can you just hire some image processing engineers from 
Apple? You have great image sensors. But, man, the color of photos looks really weird 
sometimes. Even Samsung's photo looks better than yours on their phones... And they are using 
stupid AMOLED.From a super Sony fan.
